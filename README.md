# Assignment

Let's learn day to day git commands and concepts by building a simple calculator application using HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and Bootstrap4.

If you don't know HTML, CSS, JS and Bootstrap4 don't worry. This repo has all the code that is required to build the application. You just need to copy paste the code for respective branches from this template repo in order to complete this assignment.

## Goal of this assignment is to make you learn:
- [x] Creating Github account & configuring SSH key 
- [x] Creating new local git repository from sratch 
- [x] Linking local repo to the remote github repo 
- [x] Working with feature branches 
- [x] Setting upstream branches
- [x] Raising pull requests 
- [x] Using pull requests for doing code reviews 
- [x] Merging of branches on remote repo
- [x] Pulling latest changes from the remote repo
- [x] Resolving merge conflicts
- [x] Tagging source code for the release
- [x]  Day to day git commands vit git command line interface

## Pay attention to the following points:
1.	Make sure name of your repo in Github is “SimpleCalculator”. Don't use some other name. Pay attention to the case sensitivity
2.	Make sure your repo has following branches ('feature/' suffix is mandatory for each of the feature branches):
   - master
   - develop
   - feature/header
   - feature/footer
   - feature/add
   - feature/subtract
   - feature/multiply
   - feature/divide
3.	Make sure commit messages matches with the respective message in the below mentioned steps
4.	Number of pull requests in your repo must match with this template repo. Also the pull request content must also match
5.	Content of latest commit in each of your feature, develop and master branch must match with the respective branches in this repo
6.	Number of commitsin each of your feature, develop and master branch must match with the respective branches in this repo

#### Note:
Make your repo public. Submitted assignments will be evaluated through a script and not adhering to the above mentioned guidelines will lead you to fail in the test. 

Your completed assignment should look exactly same as this repo except the README file.

## Branching Guidelines

![Maveric Git Branching structure](./branching-explained.png)

## Steps for resolving merge conflict:
Suppose there is a merge conflict in one of the feature branch then you need to follow below mentioned steps for resolving the merge conflict:

1. Checkout to develop branch using (assuming develop branch is the target branch for the pull request)
2. Execute “git pull” to update your local develop branch (assuming develop branch is setup to track origin/develop)
3. Switch to the feature branch 
4. Merge develop branch changes to the feature branch via “git merge develop”
5. Resolve all the merge conflicts by opening the files having conflict in your favourtie editor
6. Stage all the resolved files via “git add <file-name>” 
7. Complete the merge by commiting the staged changes git commit -m “Commit message” 
8. Push the merged changes to the corresponding remote feature branch via “git push” (assuming upstream branch has been already setup for your local feature branch)
9. Merge the pull request in remote github repo

## Some of the most commonly used git commands with useful options:
   
### Command for initial setup:
- git config --global user.name <Your name>
- git config --global user.email <Your email>

### Command to get help on any particular git command:
- git help <command-name>
- git <command-name> --help
- man git-<command-name>


### Command to get a new repo or an already existing repo:
- git init - command to initialise a new git repo inside a non git folder
- git clone - create or download a already existing git repo by using url


### Command to make changes to the git repo:
- git add - move the changes from working directory to staging already
- git commit  - commit the changes in staging area to git repo
- git status - check the status of git repo for modified, deleted or added files
- git log - to see the commit history
- git diff - to see the contents of the changed files

### Commands to work with git branches:
- git branch <branch-name> - to create a new branch
- git branch -  to view the list of branches in local repo
- git branch -r - to see the list of remote branches
- git branch  -d <branch-name> - to delete a already merged branch
- git branch -D <branch-name> - to forcefully delete a unmerged branch
- git checkout -b <branch-name> - to create a new branch and checkout to the newly created branch
- git checkout --track -b <branch-name> origin/<branch-name> - to create a new branch tracking the remote origin branch and checkout into newly created branch

### Command for undoing changes:
- git reset HEAD * - unstage all the staged changes
- git restore --staged * - unstage all the staged changes
- git checkout -- <file> - to revert back any changes to the file 

### Command to synchronise local repo with remote repo
- git remote add origin <github-repo-url>
- git push - push your changes from local to remote repo
- git pull - update you local current branch with the latest changes in the reemote tracking branch
- git push origin --delete branch-name - to delete a remote branch
- git fetch - to update remote tracking branches and to get any new branches added in the remote repo

### Command to merge branches two branches:
- git merge <source-branch> - to merge changes from source branch to current branch
- git rebase <source-branch> - to rebase current branch changes on top of source branch commits(creates a new commit id for the feature branch commits)


### Command to tag code for releases:
- git tag -a <tagname> -m <msg> - to create a annotated tag pointing to current branch head
- git tag <tagname>  - creates lightweight tag with the given name
   
### Ignoring unwanted folders and files:
- .gitignore - file containing the  list of all files and folders that needs to be ignored by git
